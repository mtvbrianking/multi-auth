```php
'providers' => array(
    // ...
    Bmatovu\MultiAuth\MultiAuthServiceProvider::class,
),
```

### Bootstrapping

```bash
php artisan multi-auth:install {guard}
```

Default guard is named: `admin` be sure to use a guard name that suits your needs.
This command will scaffold configurations, controllers, middleware, migrations, models, factories, notifications, routes, and views; to get you started.

### Run Database Migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Getting started

**Compile CSS and JS** (Optional)

_The Bootstrap and Vue scaffolding provided by Laravel as of version 6.0 is now located in the [`laravel/ui`](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/frontend#introduction) Composer package._

_In a new twist of events; Laravel will be dropping support for `laravel/ui` in later versions in favour of [`laravel/jetstream`](https://jetstream.laravel.com/). This package is not supporting the latter but we intend to catch up asap._

Note: This should be done only for fresh installations.

```bash
composer require laravel/ui

php artisan ui bootstrap

npm install && npm run dev
```

**Serve application**

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/{guard}
```

### Extras

**Check guards**

```php
$ php artisan tinker
...
>>> config('auth.guards');
```

**Access guard instance:**

Specify the guard instance you would like to use, eg using `admin` guard...

```php
Auth::guard('admin')->user();
```

**Check routes:** 

To find out which routes have been created for your guard

```bash
php artisan route:list
```

**Email verification:** 

You may require users to verify their email addresses before using the application. 
Read the [wiki](https://github.com/mtvbrianking/multi-auth/wiki/Email-Verification) on how to enable this.
